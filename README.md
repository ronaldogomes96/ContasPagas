# ContasPagas
This repository was made to make available the final project of the Systems Analysis and Design discipline of the Computer Science course at IFCE.

The final project consists of an iOS app that manages your expenses. The user will be able to register his accounts, with value and date, inform if he is paid or not and categorize his payment in personalized sections. It will also be possible to edit or delete some expenses, in addition to checking the total expenses.

The project is being done using the Swift language, along with the use of the SwiftUI framework. Firebase and CoreData are used for persistence. The architecture used will be MVVM.
